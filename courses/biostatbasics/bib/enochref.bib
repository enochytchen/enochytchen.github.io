  abstract        = {Claims databases consisting of routinely collected longitudinal records of medical expenditures are increasingly utilized for estimating expected medical costs of patients with a specific condition. Survival data of the patients of interest are usually highly censored, and observed expenditures are incomplete. In this study, we propose a survival-adjusted estimator for estimating mean lifetime costs, which integrates the product of the survival function and the mean cost function over the lifetime horizon. The survival function is estimated by a new algorithm of rolling extrapolation, aided by external information of age- and sex-matched referents simulated from national vital statistics. The mean cost function is estimated by a weighted average of mean expenditures of patients in a number of months prior to their death, of which the number could be determined by observed costs in their final months, and the weights depend on extrapolated hazards. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with that of a popular method using simulated data under various scenarios and 2 cohorts of intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke patients with a maximum follow-up of 13Â years and conclude that our new method estimates the mean lifetime costs more accurately.},

	survival, crude mortality, net survival and relative survival ratio)
	and study their differences using colon and prostate cancer data
	extracted from the national population-based cancer registry of Slovenia
	as well as simulated data. The colon and prostate cancer data demonstrate
	clearly that when analysing population-based data, it is useful to
	split the overall mortality in crude probabilities of dying from
	cancer and from other causes. Complemented by net survival, it provides
	a complete picture of cancer survival in a given population. But
	when comparisons of different populations as defined for example
	by place or time are of interest, our simulated data demonstrate
	that net survival is the only measure to be used. The choice of the
	method should be done in two steps: first, one should determine the
	measure of interest and second, one should choose among the methods
	that estimate that measure consistently.},
