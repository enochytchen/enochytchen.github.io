This course material is based on my learning from \href{https://staff.ki.se/people/analam}{Anastasia Lam}'s teachings in last year's Applied Epidemiology I lab sessions, and readings from \textit{Epidemiology} by Gordis \cite{Gordis2014}, \textit{A First Course in Probability and Statistics} by Goldsman and Goldsman \cite{Goldsman2020}, \textit{Principles of Biostatistics} by Pagano and Gauvreau \cite{Pagano2000}, and \textit{Biostatistics I} by Gabriel and Frumento \cite{Gabriel2020}. 

I especially want to thank Marlene Stratmann for reviewing the slides and Prof. Paul Dickman for providing me with suggestions to improving the teaching.
