\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{About my thesis}

Both these two methods adopt restricted cubic splines, shown below
\begin{equation}
s(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{n} \beta_{0 j} x^{j}+\sum_{i=1}^{K} \sum_{j=0}^{N} \beta_{i j}\left(x-k_{i}\right)_{+}^{j},
\end{equation}

Cubic splines, where $N$=3, are the most common use of spline function,  shown as 

\begin{equation}
s(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{3} \beta_{0 j} x^{j}+\sum_{i=1}^{K} \beta_{i 3}\left(x-k_{i}\right)_{+}^{3}
\end{equation}

If a cubic spline function is forced to be linear before the first knot and after the last knot, then we obtain restricted cubic spline function, which is written as 
\begin{equation}
s\left(x ; \gamma_{0}\right)=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{01} v_{1}(x)+\gamma_{02} v_{2}(x)+\ldots+\gamma_{0 K-1} v_{K-1}(x),
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item <1->  Speed is important. Direction is even more important.
	\item <2-> Peer review. (Those newbies sitting beside you are way too valuable.)
	\item <3-> We are at the place with treasure	.
